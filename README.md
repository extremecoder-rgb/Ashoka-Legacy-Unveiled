# Ashoka Legacy Unveiled

## Historical Context

### Emperor Ashoka (304-232 BCE)
Emperor Ashoka, also known as Ashoka the Great, was the third ruler of the Mauryan Empire and one of India's most influential historical figures. After witnessing the devastating consequences of the Kalinga War, Ashoka underwent a profound transformation, embracing Buddhism and dedicating his reign to the principles of non-violence (ahimsa), religious tolerance, and social welfare.

### The Mauryan Empire
The Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE) was one of the largest and most powerful empires in ancient India, spanning from present-day Afghanistan to Bangladesh. Under Ashoka's rule, the empire reached its zenith, not just in terms of territorial expansion but also in cultural and architectural achievements.
